# AWS Inferentia Hands-on Labs

This repository provides an easy hands-on way to get started with AWS Inferentia.
A demonstration of this hands-on can be seen in the AWS Innovate 2023 - AIML Edition session.
Please refer to the AWS Neuron SDK official developer guide for details.

## Requirements
Before you begin, you'll need to prepare at least one of the instances below. 
- AWS Inf1 EC2 instances (https://aws.amazon.com/ko/ec2/instance-types/inf1/)
- AWS Trn1 EC2 instances (https://aws.amazon.com/ko/ec2/instance-types/trn1/)
- AWS Inf2 EC2 instances (https://aws.amazon.com/ko/ec2/instance-types/inf2/)

A CPU instance (e.g., `c5.xlarge`) is also possible as long as you only compile the model with the Neuron SDK.

## Getting Started

### [Inf1 instance (AWS Innovate 2023 Demo)](inf1)
### [Trn1/Inf2 instance](trn1_and_inf2)
